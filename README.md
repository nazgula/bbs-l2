Take note:
If you get the error, 'could not detect network', after running the local node,
just keep on trying (it may take a minute or tow).

IMPORTANT:
After executing scripts/initL2.js you will get console prints
  L1_ERC20 deployed [0xAddress]
  L2_ERC20 deployed [0xAddress]
COPY THOSE ADDRESSES INTO test/test.js consts
  L2BBS_ADDRESS
  L1BBS_ADDRESS
